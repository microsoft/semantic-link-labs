    Identifies the lakehouse used by a Direct Lake semantic model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dataset : str
        Name of the semantic model.
    workspace : str, default=None
        The Fabric workspace name.
        Defaults to None which resolves to the workspace of the attached lakehouse

    lakehouse : str, default=None
        The Fabric lakehouse used by the Direct Lake semantic model.
        Defaults to None which resolves to the lakehouse attached to the notebook.
    lakehouse_workspace : str, default=None
        The Fabric workspace used by the lakehouse.
