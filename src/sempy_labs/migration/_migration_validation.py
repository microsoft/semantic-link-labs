    """
    Shows the objects in the original semantic model and whether then were migrated successfully or not.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dataset : str
        Name of the import/DirectQuery semantic model.
    new_dataset : str
        Name of the Direct Lake semantic model.
    workspace : str, default=None
        The Fabric workspace name in which the import/DirectQuery semantic model exists.
        Defaults to None which resolves to the workspace of the attached lakehouse
        or if no lakehouse attached, resolves to the workspace of the notebook.
    new_dataset_workspace : str
        The Fabric workspace name in which the Direct Lake semantic model will be created.
        Defaults to None which resolves to the workspace of the attached lakehouse
        or if no lakehouse attached, resolves to the workspace of the notebook.

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.DataFrame
       A pandas dataframe showing a list of objects and whether they were successfully migrated. Also shows the % of objects which were migrated successfully.
