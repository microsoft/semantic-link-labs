    Remaps a table (or tables) in a Direct Lake semantic model to a table in a lakehouse.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dataset : str
        Name of the semantic model.
    table_name : str, List[str]
        Name of the table(s) in the semantic model.
    entity_name : str, List[str]
        Name of the lakehouse table to be mapped to the semantic model table.
    workspace : str, default=None
        The Fabric workspace name in which the semantic model exists.
        Defaults to None which resolves to the workspace of the attached lakehouse

    lakehouse : str, default=None
        The Fabric lakehouse used by the Direct Lake semantic model.

        The Fabric workspace used by the lakehouse.
