    Shows the calculated tables and their respective DAX expression for a Direct Lake model (which has been migrated from import/DirectQuery).

    Parameters
    ----------
    dataset : str
        Name of the semantic model.
    workspace : str, default=None
        The Fabric workspace name.
        Defaults to None which resolves to the workspace of the attached lakehouse

    pandas.DataFrame
        A pandas dataframe showing the calculated tables which were migrated to Direct Lake and whose DAX expressions are stored as model annotations.
